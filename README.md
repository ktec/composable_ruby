# Lessons from Professor Frisby Introduces Composable ~~Javascript~~ Ruby


This is a collection of ruby scripts created as notes when following the wonderful "Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Javascript" series available for free on egghead.io:

The concepts and ideas have been faithfully translated, with some small artistic licence to introduce a more idiomatic ruby style.

It's a fun course that introduces Either, Semigroups, and briefly touches on Monoids, and shows how this might be useful to you.

Great to know and learn.

If you have thoughts, ideas, comments or feedback, please get in touch.
